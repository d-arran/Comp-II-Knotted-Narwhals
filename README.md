-- Approach 1 -- Object Oriented

Braid.m, Knot.m, Path.m written by Arran, algorithm involves recording paths connected in smoothing operations, and counting the number of cycles in the full smoothing. Braid algorithm invovles tracing through the diagram, labelling each crossing with relevant information on each pass.

A list of examples can be found at Object-Classes/Examples.m, alongside code comments to better explain what is going on.

-- Approach 2 -- Functional

JonesPolynomial.m written by Thomas.B, algorithm involves removing a crossing and creating two new planar diagrams that represent the A- and B-smoothings of the original planar diagram.
