-- Approach 1 -- Object Oriented

Braid.m, Knot.m, Path.m written by Arran, algorithm involves recording paths connected in smoothing operations, and counting the number of cycles in the full smoothing.

-- Approach 2 -- Functional

JonesPolynomial.m written by Thomas.B, algorithm involves removing a crossing and creating two new planar diagrams that represent the A- and B-smoothings of the original planar diagram.
